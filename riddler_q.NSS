/*
    this is the database of the riddles.
    also, it sets the riddlers local
    as well as the riddle key number.
    it needs to fetch the answer strings from that
    database/script.

    add your riddles to the end, incrementing the case number.
    change int nMax to = your last case number +1 (ie for 200, use 201)
    keep track of your riddle numbers to use
    in the answer database.

NOTICE:  a riddle cannot be longer than 511 characters.
         yes, 512 is one too many!
